> **A modern solution to the retirement dilemma**: How can retirees protect their portfolios from market crashes while maintaining growth potential?

This project uses operations research and optimization to find cost-effective combinations of S&P 500 put options that provide downside protection while preserving upside potential.

## The Problem

With the U.S. population aged 65+ projected to nearly double from 52 million (2018) to 95 million (2060), millions of retirees face a critical challenge:

- **Stay in stocks?** Risk catastrophic losses right when income stops
- **Move to bonds?** Accept minimal returns and lose purchasing power to inflation

We use optimization to determine:

1. What is the optimal protection level for retirement portfolios?
2. What is the cheapest combination of options to achieve that protection?
