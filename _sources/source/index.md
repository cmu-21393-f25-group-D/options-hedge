# Portfolio Insurance Project

Welcome to our Operations Research class project! This repository contains the starting point for implementing a portfolio insurance strategy using options on the S&P 500 index.

## Project Overview

We're building a solution for retirees who want to:
1. Keep their money in stocks for growth potential
2. Protect against major market crashes using options
3. Minimize the cost of this protection

## Current Status

This is currently a starter template with:
1. Basic project structure
2. Development environment setup
3. CI/CD pipeline configuration
4. Simple Gurobi example to verify setup

See the [Hello World Example](hello_world.md) to verify your setup is working correctly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the [Installation](installation.md) guide
3. Run the hello world example
4. Check that tests pass

## Next Steps

As a team, we'll need to:
1. Design the mathematical model
2. Implement option pricing
3. Create the optimization model
4. Add analysis tools
5. Write documentation
